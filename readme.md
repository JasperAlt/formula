This file works with KaTeX to make interactive mathematical formulas ([here](jalt.online/homophily.html)). The user specifies a formula and its behavior as a nonstandard \<formula> HTML tag, which can contain internal variables in \<var> tags and behaviors in \<rule> and \<timer> tags. \<matrix> tags can be used to create matrices. For now these are html tables with a KaTeX formula in each cell, but eventually that should be replaced with a canvas-based implementation.

I wrote a few versions of these recyclable objects to visualize the math I was studying in my graduate degree. Every version evolves in an ad-hoc way. I started out working from a blog post on object-oriented d3, but in this version I found the nonstandard html tags more useful. Since then when I touch the project I've been working to make those custom elements meet the HTML standard instead of just being hooks for D3 to insert other stuff. 

Visually, my goal was to have no extra elements that wouldn't be in a normal mathematical text, like buttons or sliders, to control figures. Interactive text describing a figure should be sufficient to control it, and when the figure is not moving, the text should always accurately describe its current state, allowing the page to be read like an ordinary text.
