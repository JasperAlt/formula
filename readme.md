This file works with KaTeX to make interactive mathematical formulas (as seen [here](web.cecs.pdx.edu/jalt/netsci_supplemental.html) or [here](web.cecs.pdx.edu/jalt/moran.html)). The user specifies a formula and its behavior as a nonstandard \<formula> HTML tag, which can contain internal variables in \<var> tags and behaviors in \<rule> and \<timer> tags. \<matrix> tags can be used to create matrices. For now these are html tables with a KaTeX formula in each cell, but eventually that should be replaced with a canvas-based implementation.

My attitude developing this has been that there should be no extra elements over a normal mathematical text, like buttons or sliders, to control figures. Interactive text describing a figure should be sufficient to control it.
